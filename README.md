"BabyNet: A Neural Framework Inspired by Cognitive Development for Efficient Learning and Forgetting in Artificial Systems"
Abstract

This paper introduces BabyNet, an AI architecture inspired by the rapid learning and selective forgetting mechanisms observed in early childhood cognitive development. By integrating techniques such as cyclical learning rates, attention mechanisms, pruning, and dynamic adaptability, BabyNet achieves robust learning and generalization. This study bridges biological principles with advanced neural network architectures, demonstrating applications across autonomous systems, personalized recommendation engines, and adaptive robotics.
